# MLOps Tutorial

**Motivation:** How to use Pytest, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker to build an MLOps pipeline.  
Since many people have asked me how to build an MLOps pipeline, I thought it would be helpful to write a tutorial.

There are different ways to build an MLOps pipeline, but I think the most common approach is to use Pytest, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker.  
This tutorial will show you how to build an MLOps pipeline using these tools.

## 1. Create a Simple Deep Learning Model with Pytest

Pytest is a testing framework for Python. It is a powerful tool for testing your code.  
Pytest is mature, well-maintained, and widely used in the industry.

## 2. Use CI Pipelines to Automatically Run Pytest on Every Pull Request

A CI/CD pipeline is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process.  
It is a powerful tool for making sure your code is always tested and ready to deploy.

## 3. Use CD Pipelines to Deploy the Code as a Python Package

A CD pipeline is used to deploy your code as a Python package.  
This makes it easy to distribute and reuse your code.

## 4. Use Docker to Package the Model into a Container

Docker is a containerization tool that packages your code and dependencies into a single container.  
This makes it easy to deploy and run your model in different environments.
